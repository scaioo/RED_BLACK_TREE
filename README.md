# Red-Black Tree Implementation in C++

A robust and efficient implementation of a Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree (Red-Black Tree) in C++. This project was developed to demonstrate fundamental data structure concepts, including rotations, balancing, and tree traversals.

## 🚀 Features
* **Full Implementation**: Support for Insertion, Deletion, and Search.
* **Self-Balancing**: Maintains $O(\log n)$ time complexity for all primary operations.
* **Visualization**: Includes a utility to print the tree structure in the console with color indicators (Red/Black).
* **Memory Safe**: Proper destructor handling to prevent memory leaks.
